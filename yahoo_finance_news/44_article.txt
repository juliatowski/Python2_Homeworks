UPDATE 1-U.S. coffee importer sees delay of up to 5 weeks on Colombian cargos
(Includes details of situation in Colombia)

NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - U.S.-based coffee importer Caravela told clients on Friday that shipments of Colombian coffees will be delayed by up to five weeks as anti-government protests in the country have blocked transportation routes to ports.
Caravela, which sells fine coffees from several origins to roasters in the United States, said the protests have halted shipments of beans from its dry mill in Armenia, in the western part of Colombia, to the ports of Buenaventura and Cartagena.
"Additionally, movement from our multiple warehouses to the dry mill has been challenging with multiple sporadic blockades on the roads to Armenia delaying arrival of parchment and affecting the processing queue," the importer added in a note to clients and partners.
Blockades were still in place in Colombia despite a government order for the military to clear them.
The protests cut supplies of food and fuel, and hurt exports. The local coffee federation estimated that more than half a million 60-kg bags could not be shipped to clients abroad.
Colombia is the world's second largest producer of arabica coffee, and its mild, high-quality beans have a large market in the United States, the world's largest consumer of the beverage.
Caravela said it was working with authorities and partners to try to find ways to resume transportation.
The company told clients it could offer coffees from the other six countries from where it sources beans to replace Colombian shipments if roasters can not wait. (Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Leslie Adler and David Gregorio)

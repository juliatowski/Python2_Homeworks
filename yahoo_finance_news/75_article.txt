U.S. coffee importer sees delay of up to 5 weeks on Colombian cargos
NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - U.S.-based coffee importer Caravela told clients on Friday that shipments of Colombian coffees will be delayed by up to five weeks as a result of anti-government protests in the country that have blocked transportation routes to ports.
Caravela, which sells fine coffees from several origins to roasters in the U.S., said the protests have completely halted shipments of beans from its dry mill in Armenia to the Colombian ports of Buenaventura and Cartagena. (Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Leslie Adler)

China says Martian rover takes first drive on surface of Red Planet
BEIJING, May 22 (Reuters) - A remote-controlled Chinese motorised rover drove down the ramp of a landing capsule on Saturday and onto the surface of the Red Planet, making China the first nation to orbit, land and deploy a land vehicle on its inaugural mission to Mars.
Zhurong, named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, drove down to the surface of Mars at 10:40 a.m. Beijing time (0240 GMT), according to a post on the rover's official Chinese social media account. (Reporting by Ryan Woo and Yilei Sun; Editing by William Mallard)
